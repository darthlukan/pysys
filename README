Pysys
====================================

This project started off as a folder of scripts that I was
using to teach myself Python, it has since turned into a
holding ground for a few different small-scale projects,
exercises, templates, and mish-mash of unfinished ideas.

Some of the things in this repo are useful, others, not so much.
Nothing here is considered "complete", but if you can use any of it
to learn with, or just gain ideas on different things to try,
then by all means, feel free to use what's in here.

Also, feel free to let me know if you do use anything, I'd
like to think that this repo can be useful outside of a personal
memory bank :)

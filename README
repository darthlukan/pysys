pysys is a collection of scripts that I have written/will be writing
to increase the amount of automation present on my system.  It is meant 
as a practice project for me to expand my knowledge of programming in Python
and for usage examples for prospective employers of what I am capable of.

If you are able to use these to help you in your own projects, please let
me know!  It's always nice to know that you've contributed something to 
the community :)
